# E-Mail Simulation
In this repository you will find the implementation of the **E-Mail Simulation** as part of the master's thesis on the topic of "Synthetische Daten zum Training von künstlicher Intelligenz im Marketing – eine Analyse am Beispiel E-Mail Marketing". During the summer term, a simulation engine was created based on parameters that influence the email marketing opening rate in the online buyer market of home fitness equipment. The full text can be requested from the author.

## Research approach
The project aims to approach a problem solution via the following research questions:
1.  
2.  
3.  

## System specification via UML
The system specification consisting of a sequence flow diagram and class diagram, can be found in the [Documentation](https://github.com/SamuelPassauer/Email_Simulation/tree/master/Documentation) folder.

## Simulation results
The results of a single exemplary simulation run including the synthetic dataset, can be found in the [Results](https://github.com/SamuelPassauer/Email_Simulation/tree/master/results) folder.

## Installation and operating instructions
Information on installation and operation of the program code can be found in the Documentation folder in the [Installation and Operation Manual](https://github.com/SamuelPassauer/Email_Simulation/tree/master/Documentation/Installations-%20und%20Bedienungsanleitung.md) file.
